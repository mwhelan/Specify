# Acceptance Specifications

The acceptance specs are the component tests in Martin Fowler's [microservices testing strategy](https://martinfowler.com/articles/microservice-testing/#testing-component-introduction).

The in-process component tests run in the private build and build pipeline and the same tests can run out-of-process against deployed services in the release pipeline.
